      <br>
      <p>I'm a forum webmaster turned full-stack dev after php destroyed my third-party hosting site. So I took it upon myself gain the skills necessary to bring our website back from the internet grave.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Add me to your team! I've always had a penchant for team activities and have a way with synergizing my skills with my team's. My experience as a bartender and sevice work in high volume establishments speaks to my skills as a team player. I've worked with food and beverage education so I'm always down to learn and teach. You need quality fruit to make good wine, and the same can be said for any team endeavor. A strong team puts together great projects.</p>
